# Portfolio
A place to store all of my commits to the course portfolio.

The weeks are separated into their relevant folders with each question separated into a relatively named .py file.

Definitions of key terminology throughout this course will be stored in the file named 'Key Terminology' housed within the root 'Portfolio' directory.

'Experimental' is an area to troubleshoot and practice difficult concepts learned throughout the course that aren't covered in the 'tasks' or 'homework' directories, or may just be an area to further explore some of those concepts.
